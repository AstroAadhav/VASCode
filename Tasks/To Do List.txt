Tasks:

1. Replace quadrotor dynamics with rocket dynamics in quadODEFunctionHF
	Forces: Fsum = Fgravity + Faerodynamics + Fthrust + Fdisturbances
		     = g*[0; 0; -1](inertial frame) + Faero + R_BI*ThrustMagnitude*[-1; 0; 0](body frame) + Fdist 
	a. Aerodynamics Calculator
		-Create a function that calculates lift and drag on the canards, fins, and rocket body
		-Inputs: current velocity, altitude (to calculate air properties such as pressure, temp, density, etc.; 
			zI-component of position?), canard angle of attack (?)
		-Output: 3 x 5 matrix containing the total aerodynamic force on each canard, body 
			(each column represents the x, y, z components in the inertial frame); Note: Fcanard = sqrt(Lift^2 + Drag^2)
	
	Fmat = AeroCalc(inputs)

	b. Thrust Calculator
		-Create a fuction that outputs a matrix of thrust over the whole simulation time
		-outputs to new substructure called S.thrustMat in the topSimulate.m script
		-similar to the S.distMat (matrix of distubance forces over the whole simulation time; [Fx; Fy; Fz])
		-need to determine the motor and obtain a thrust curve
		-may need to do some interpolation to get the force at the same time intervals as the simulation
		-Inputs: thrust curve, simulation time
		-Outputs: (N-1) x 1 matrix of thrust force over the simulation time (assuming thrust only acts along the -x direction with respect to the rocket body (-xB))

2. Moment Calculator




3. Replace the quadrotor properties with rocket properties in quadParams.m



Things to keep in mind:
- Keep track of any variables needed as well as sensors required
- Since we are modifying old code we must be careful with renaming old files and variables
- Eventually, may need to rewrite all the scripts so that they better reflect the fact that this is a rocket simulator, not a quadrotor simulator
