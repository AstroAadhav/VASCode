Challenge: 
	Write a MATLAB script that plots a two or three bar linkage with each bar rotating
	at a different rate. See 'Rotating Link Animation' for an example. This is to 
	practice using rotation matrices and writing MATLAB code. See the 'LinkGraph' file 
	for code on how to plot the figure. There's no physics involved, just a rotation of 
	points about a single axis.
